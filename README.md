<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I can't pretend to be of perfect memory, and the people who design astronomy equipment to be black *at night in the dark* are a special kind of sadist. At 0500, when your lens cover has long since blown away, you can rest easy knowing that a cheap, 3D printable replacement can be made at the drop of a hat (or about 30 hours, if you have a small print bed like me). This can be printed on an Ender 3 at an angle with supports, but requires a larger print bed to be printed flat. 


<!-- DESIGN DESCRIPTION -->
## Design

This lens cover copies the original lens cover from the RASA, and mates easily into the slots at the front of the scope. Since this version has a flat face, the cover can be printed in place with no supports. If you have a small bed, you can still print the part at an angle. I suggest printing with at least 4 wall layers; infill can be set to 15% without reducing part strength significantly. 

A watermarked version is available on Thingiverse, if you want to represent my website. Of course, if you are reading this you already know about it!
